    "As far as I know there are two major contributors to radioactivity in humans. The primary is Carbon-14, and the secondary is Potassium-40. According to the wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_of_the_human_body#Elemental_composition_list we can take the mass fraction. Carbon is 18% of an average person by mass, while potassium is 0.2% of an average person by mass. Both of these primarily produce beta radiation, however K40 can also undergo electron capture. The branching ratio for K40 is .8928$\\beta^-$, 0.1072$\\epsilon$ according to NuDat3. The primary source of radiation from this will be beta rays, however many will be shielded so a large number of x-rays from bremsstrahlung and gamma rays from the electron capture are likely. "
